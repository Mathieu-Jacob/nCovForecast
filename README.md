# nCovForecast - Canada
Code for nCov forecasting tool (Shiny app)
Adapted specifically for Canada provinces from https://benflips.shinyapps.io/nCovForecast/

Takes data amalgamated for the John Hopkins nCov tracker, breaks it down by provinces of Canada and:

1. gives simple projections of confirmed cases for next ten days;
2. estimates (roughly) detection probability in each country and reports detection-corrected values
3. shows growth rates in each country over last ten days (tracking success at curve flatenning)
